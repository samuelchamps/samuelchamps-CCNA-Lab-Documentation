# Lab2 (Interface & cables)
Ethernet is a collection of network protocols & standards
## Some terminologies
- RJ45 It is also known as Registered Jack 45. It is used on a copper ethernet cable.
- Bit It is a binary value either 0 or 1
- Bytes is 8 bits
- Speed is measured in bit/s (bps), Kb/s (kbps), Mb/s (Mbps), Gb/s (Gbps), Tb/s (tbps)
- Full duplex is when both devices can send and recieve data without collision because they have separate wires.
- Amdix- It helps to detect where wires can be connected
- SFP - Small form factor pluggable

## Types of cables used in this lab
- UTP
### Charisteristics
- It is cheap
- It is vulnerable to EMI
- It have a length of 100m
- It is always plugged to RJ45
- It emitt signals outside the cable

## fibre optics
### Charisteristics
- It is expensive
- It is not vulnerable to EMI
- It have a longer distance >100m
- It is always plugged to SFP
- It doesn't emitt signals outside the cable

## UTP
- Ethernet cable which have an informal name as 10BT (10BaseT). The IEEE standard for the ethernet is 802.3i. It have a speed of 10mbps and a length of 100m.
- Fast Ethernet cable which have an informal name as 100BT (100BaseT). The IEEE standard for the ethernet is 802.3u. It have a speed of 100mbps and a length of 100m.
- Gigbit Ethernet cable which have an informal name as 1000BT (1000BaseT). The IEEE standard for the ethernet is 802.3ab. It have a speed of 1gbps and a length of 100m.
- 10Gigbit Ethernet cable which have an informal name as 10GT (10GBaseT). The IEEE standard for the ethernet is 802.3an. It have a speed of 10gbps and a length of 100m.

## Fibre optics 
- Single mode 
- Multi-mode 

- 1000Base-LX have a length of 550m for multi-mode and 5km for single-mode. The IEEE standard for this cable is 802.3z. It is have a speed of 1Gbps.

- 10GBase-SR is a multi mode cable and have a length of 400m. The IEEE standard for this cable is 802.3ae and have a speed of 10Gbps.

- 10GBase-LR is a single mode cable and have a length of 10km. The IEEE standard for this cable is 802.3ae and have a speed of 10Gbps.

- 10GBase-ER is a single mode cable and have a length of 30km. The IEEE standard for this cable is 802.3ae and have a speed of 10Gbps.
